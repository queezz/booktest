- $t \gtrsim 1\;\text{ns}$. after the big bang universe is a gas of fundamental particles: [quarks and antiquarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark), [leptons and antileptons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton), neutrinos and antineutrinos, and gluons and photons.
  -  After cooling to $T<10^{14}$ K, the quarks, antiquarks and gluons mostly disappeared. Fortunately the number of quarks slightly exceeded the number of antiquarks due to [matter-antimatter asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry). A few leftover quarks formed protons and neutrons present today.
- $1\;\text{ms} <t< 1\;\text{s}$. Universe is a gas of neutrons and protons ($n$, $p$), electrons and positrons ($e^{-}$, $e^{+}$), neutrinos and antineutrinos ($\nu$, $\bar{\nu}$), and photons ($\gamma$).
  -  As the temperature fell below $T \approx 10^{10}$ K, the density of the universe became too low for neutrinos to interact effectively with mater. These non-interacting, decoupled neutrons now form a universal gas which has cooled due to expansion of the universe to $T_{\nu}\approx 2$ K.
  -  Soon after the decoupling of the $\nu$, the annihilation of $e^{-}-e^{+}$ pairs removed all the positrons and most of the electrons.
- $t>100\;\text{s}$. $n+p$ formed light nuclei, leading to universe in which $\sim 75\%$ of the mass consists of hydrogen and $\sim 25\%$ is helium.
- $t \gtrsim 300'000\;\text{years}$, $T < 4000\;\text{K}$. Temperature low enough for formation of stable atoms. Photons ceased to interact strongly with matter. Universe became transparent to electromagnetic radiation. This radiation, detected by [Penzias and Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_cosmic_microwave_background_radiation), cooled down to $T_{\gamma} \approx 3\;\text{K}$, warmer than $\nu$ due to warming up by $e^{-}-e^{+}$ annihilation.
- Expansion and cooling of the universe until it reached its present lumpy condition with mos of the matter assembled in stars, galaxies and clusters of galaxies.
