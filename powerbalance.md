# Power balance in a tokamak


# JET "break-evens"
From "Sun in a Bottle" {cite:p}`Reinders2021`:
> In 1997, as we will see below, in its tritium operation the JET tokamak
achieved $Q = (16 MW)/(24 MW) \approx 0.67$, meaning that just 67% of the
plasma power input came out as heat.

In December 2021, JET did it again, slightly better this time, or so they say {cite:p}`Gibney2021`:
> In an experiment on 21 December 2021, JET’s tokamak produced 59 megajoules of energy over a fusion ‘pulse’ of 5 seconds — more than double the 21.7 megajoules released in 1997 over around 4 seconds. Although the 1997 experiment still retains the record for ‘peak power’, that spike lasted for only a fraction of a second, and the experiment’s average power was less than half that of the latest test, says Fernanda Rimini, a plasma scientist at the CCFE who oversaw last year’s experimental campaign. JET’s latest experiment sustained a Q of 0.33 for 5 seconds, says Rimini.
